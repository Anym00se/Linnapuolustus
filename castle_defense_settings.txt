/// Castle Defense Settings ///

# These are settings that affect the difficulty and gameplay in Castle Defense.
# All modifiers are linear: smaller modifiers mean lower stats, easier enemies or worse towers.

# Difficulty affects enemies' spawnrate and their increasing health buff.
# Set difficulty > 150 for extreme difficulty: only Large Enemy units spawn.
# Splash modifier affects splash effectiveness, the bigger the modifier the more the affected enemies slow down.
# Enemy range is how near the enemy has to be for the castle to start losing HP.
# Enemy speed modifier shouldn't be more than 25 with current update frequency (100ms) due to pathfinding.
# Tower spots and Enemy route chunks set coordinates for Tower spots and Enemy route.
# Enemy route points should be set in order.
# Tower spots can be in any order, but for player's convenience spots should be in order.

# All settings files should follow this template format due to file reader's limitations.
# This means don't add comments between the header and the value or between _begin and _end lines.
# Tower spots and Enemy route chunks should both have at least one coordinate.
